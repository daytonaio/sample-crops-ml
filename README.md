# <p align="center">TerraGrow: Grow Smart, Plant Right</p>

## Sample Machine Learning for Crop Growth 

## Overview
TerraGrow is an intelligent web app that uses a Random Forest model for crop recommendations and the Llama3-8b-8192 model from Groq to suggest yield improvement strategies. By analyzing factors like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, and pH, it provides data-driven insights to help farmers optimize planting decisions and achieve higher yields.


# Dataset 
[Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) is being used for this project. You can get this dataset from kaggle.

## âœ¨ Features
